# A fuel consumption study of Stata's auto dataset

We conduct a study of the fuel consumption of cars in Stata's auto dataset.

We generate a variable, **fuel**, that measures the fuel consumption rate in the unit of 
Gallons per 100 Miles.

<<dd_do>>
generate fuel = 100/mpg
label variable fuel "Fuel consumption (Gallons per 100 Miles)"

## Explore relationship between fuel consumption and vehicle weight

The regression shows that for every unit increase in weight, a 
<<dd_display:%9.4f eb[1,1]>> unit increase in fuel consumption is predicted.
